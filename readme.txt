### Raytracing in a weekend

This is a very quick project to learn about raytracing! I am following the guide laid out by Peter Shirley at https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#outputanimage

I hope to add some functionalities when I complete the project and fully understand it's contents.
